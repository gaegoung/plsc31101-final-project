## Short Description

My final project analyzes the sentiment on the issue of trade in 2016 presidential campaign speeches. I scrape presidential campaign speeches by 3 candidates - Hilary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump - from web(https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu). I execute sentiment analysis on the paragraphs that contain the word "trade" and look at how the sentiment varies by presidential candidates.
